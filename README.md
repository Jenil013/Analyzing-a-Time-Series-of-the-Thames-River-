# Analyzing a Time Series of the Thames River in Python

Note: You can consult the solution of this live training in the file browser as notebook-solution.ipynb

Time series data is everywhere, from watching your stock portfolio to monitoring climate change, and even live-tracking as local cases of a virus become a global pandemic. In this live code-along, you’ll work with a time series that tracks the tide levels of the Thames River. You’ll first load the data and inspect it data visually, and then perform calculations on the dataset to generate some summary statistics. Next, you’ll decompose the time series into its component attributes. You’ll end with a taster of autocorrelation: a first step in time series forecasting.

The original dataset is available from the British Oceanographic Data Center here and you can read all about this fascinating archival story in this article from the Nature journal.

Here's a map of the locations of the tidal gauges along the River Thames in London.
